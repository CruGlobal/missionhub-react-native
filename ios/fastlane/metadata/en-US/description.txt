See God at work and know you are part of it.

God invites us to join in with what He’s doing in the people all around us. MissionHub gives you a place to prioritize those people so you can make the most of every moment with them. And you know what? You’ll grow closer to God, too.

While everyone's spiritual life is unique, many people progress through a five stage journey toward God. MissionHub uses these stages to help you decide how you can best join them on that journey.

Whether it’s praying for someone, inviting them for coffee or telling them about your journey with God, choose your own steps of faith and MissionHub keeps you focused on the people you care about.

Over time you can see how your relationships are developing because this is the story of you, God, and the people you both love. He wants you to see Him at work, and know you are part of it.

We love hearing from you about how you’re seeing God work. Feel free to write us at support [at] missionhub [dot] com. If you need any help, you can always go to help.missionhub.com or write us an email.
