We often need help focussing on the people God places in our life. That’s why we created Focus Your Week. 

Now one tap let’s you choose up to three steps you want to take. You choose your steps. We send you handcrafted reminders. No-one gets forgotten.

Speaking of forgotten, how embarrassing is it when you can’t remember that deep or special detail someone shares with you? Our new Notes feature helps you show that you care by giving you a place to save whatever you want to remember about the people you’re focused on, like their favorite food, hobbies they love or something they said. 

There’s other fixes and additions, but what is all this really about?  Well, an angel said it best to the prophet Zechariah, “Don’t despise small beginnings.” We could think the same way about small steps of faith we take with others. We’re excited for you to grow closer to God by helping others experience him.
