MissionHub Apple Review Docs:

(NOTE: Provided credentials are for a FACEBOOK account, AND WILL NOT WORK with TheKey. There's no differences w/in the app once authenticated with one provider or the other.)

MissionHub is built to connect with the online follow-up system at www.missionhub.com. The MissionHub app connects to a web API to provide data securely over HTTPS to users. Login is handled by Facebook and/or The Key (CAS implementation) and we never see a user's account credentials.

An organization and account has been set up for you to access the app as a user would. A Facebook account is required for use, so we have also provided you with a real Facebook account to test with. We have also pre-populated the organization with a handful of contacts. The provided user has the highest level of permissions and can access every feature in the app.

To login, from the home screen: Choose "Already have an account? Log in." and then enter the provided credentials for Facebook login.

CREDENTIALS:
u: test.account@missionhub.com
p: Missionhub2014

The account we gave you as already agreed to allow the MHub Facebook app permissions to their data. Upon logging in for the first time a user would be asked to grant or deny access to some of their Facebook data.

In your organization you can create people, record interactions with people, view their ministry activity stats etc. Please play around as you figure out if our app meets your standards.

Thanks for your time.
